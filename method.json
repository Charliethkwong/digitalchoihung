      "title": "Connecting Non-linear Data",
      "content": "I invited participants to share data online, gathering experiences and memories from different generations of residents. Through reflective and visually poetic exploration, I connected non-linear and fragmented qualitative data to my own life experiences. This resulted in a data framework relevant to both participants and myself, ensuring various qualitative data could be integrated within a unified structure. This approach enhanced the coherence and accessibility of diverse narratives within virtual spaces."

      "title": "Balancing Creativity and Data Presentation",
      "content": "I explored archival studies to link practice with data presentation. Using American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), I transformed the physical characteristics of objects into standardized, symbolic, and visual data. This method not only mitigated data fragmentation but also allowed common objects to be represented abstractly. While this approach may reduce specificity and informational content, it helps evoke visual memories in the audience, creating resonance."

      "title": "Contextualizing & Situating Data",
      "content": "The research created six virtual spaces, each representing virtues linked to life fragments shared by residents of Choi Hung Estate. These virtues included frugality, humility, empathy, responsibility, adaptability, and family values. Combined, these virtues capture the spirit of Lion Rock, emphasizing perseverance, kindness, and a love of helping others. The study also incorporated dialogues from episodes of the TV show A Kindred Spirit, a TV program that was rerun for over 20 years. This creative approach strengthened cross-generational resonance, situate, and emphasize the context of the virtual spaces."
